# Laboratory

This repository has scripts for managing my DevOps laboratory.

When it comes to DevOps, I believe you don't _understand_ it unless you can _automate_ it. So, laboratory operations are entirely wrapped up in a repeatable, idempotent CLI called `lab`.

> **Warning:** Like my laboratory itself, this CLI is a _personal project_. A core purpose of the project is _learning_. I've provided it as reference and inspiration, not as a polished software product you should use.
